## Choose your starting point

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __New to cybersecurity?__

    Begin with the fundamentals: what cybersecurity means, the CIA Triad, encryption, and hashing. These are the concepts that come up in every interview.

    [Open fundamentals](fundamentals/introduction.md)

-   __Networking feels fuzzy?__

    Review IP addressing, DNS, DHCP, VPNs, firewalls, proxies, and both the OSI and TCP/IP models. They are the backbone of most security discussions.

    [Study networking](networking/basics.md)

-   __Preparing for SOC roles?__

    Focus on SIEM, EDR, IDS, IPS, incident response, IOCs, IOAs, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework — exactly what SOC analysts use daily.

    [Go to detection and defense](defense/siem_soc_edr.md)

-   __Need fast revision?__

    Jump straight into the 1200 quick-point pages. Each row gives you a clean definition, a one-sentence answer, and a real-world example.

## How to answer any security question

Follow this four-step structure and you will sound confident and clear in any technical interview:

1. **Define** the concept in one precise sentence.
2. **Explain** how it works in plain terms without unnecessary jargon.
3. **Give an example** such as a real attack, tool, or scenario.
4. **Connect** it to a control, framework, or defense strategy.

> **Example: firewall** "A firewall is a security control that filters network traffic based on predefined rules. It inspects source IPs, destination IPs, ports, and protocols to decide what is allowed or blocked. A company might block all inbound RDP from the internet at the perimeter firewall. Firewalls work alongside IDS, IPS, VPNs, and network segmentation as part of layered defense."

## Recommended study order

### Starting from zero

| Step | What to Read | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | [What is Cybersecurity?](fundamentals/introduction.md) | Build the mental model first |
| 2 | [CIA Triad](fundamentals/cia_triad.md), [Encryption](fundamentals/encryption.md), [Hashing](fundamentals/hashing.md) | The three pillars interviewers always test |
| 3 | [Networking Basics](networking/basics.md) and [OSI & TCP/IP Models](networking/osi_tcpip.md) | Everything connects through the network |
| 4 | [Vulnerabilities & Risk](threats/vulnerabilities.md) and [Modern Malware](threats/cyber_threats.md) | Know what you are defending against |
| 5 | [SIEM, SOC & EDR](defense/siem_soc_edr.md) and [Incident Response](defense/incident_response.md) | The tools and playbooks defenders use |

### Fast revision before an interview

1. Skim [Basics](quick/basics.md)
2. Review [Attacks](quick/attacks.md) and [Tools](quick/tools.md)
3. Revisit [Security frameworks](frameworks.md)
4. Finish with [IOC, IOA & MITRE ATT&CK](governance/ioc_ioa_mitre.md)

## Must-know concepts at a glance

| Concept | What it means in one line | Key tool or reference |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| CIA Triad | Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability — the three security properties everything maps to | Foundation of every control decision |
| Zero Trust | Never trust anything by default; verify every user, device, and context continuously | Zscaler, BeyondCorp, Conditional Access |
| SIEM | Centralized log collection, search, and correlation for detecting and investigating threats | Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, IBM QRadar |
| EDR | Endpoint monitoring that records behavior and supports detection, containment, and investigation | CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Defender for Endpoint |
| MFA | Verifying identity with two or more independent factors to stop credential-only attacks | Duo Security, YubiKey, Microsoft Authenticator |
| Zero-Day | A vulnerability exploited before the vendor has patched or even acknowledged it | Log4Shell, EternalBlue before patch |
| DDoS | Flooding a service with traffic from many sources until it becomes unavailable | Cloudflare, AWS Shield, scrubbing centers |
| Kill Chain | Lockheed Martin model showing how an attack progresses through seven sequential phases | Reconnaissance → Actions on Objectives |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Knowledge base of real-world adversary tactics and techniques mapped to detections | [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org) |
| IR Cycle | Structured process — Prepare, Identify, Contain, Eradicate, Recover, Lessons Learned | NIST SP 800-61 |

!!! tip "Use the site in two modes"
    **Learning mode:** Start with the guide pages under Fundamentals, Networking, Threats, and Detection. They give you context, examples, and structure.
    **Revision mode:** Switch to the quick-point pages when you want shorter answers you can review rapidly.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🏁 **Mastery-Based Learning**
Stop "speed-clicking" through documentation. SOCAtlas uses a **time-gated completion system** calibrated to technical reading speeds (200 WPM). You must engage with the content to certify mastery and earn your progress checkmarks.

### ⏯️ **Guided Flow (Autoplay)**
Prefer a hands-free experience? Turn on **Guided Flow** with adjustable speed (1x to 5x). The platform will slowly auto-scroll through the lesson and automatically advance you to the next topic once mastery is achieved.

### 🎯 **Mock Interview Simulator**
Ready for the hot seat? Use the **Interview Simulator** to test your knowledge against randomized questions pulled from our vast 1200-point database. Practice defining concepts, explaining mechanisms, and providing real-world examples.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

SOCAtlas is a high-performance static site built with **MkDocs Material** and a custom **JavaScript Success Engine**.

### **Core Technologies:**
- **Markdown:** All content is managed in simple, accessible markdown files.
- **Python Build Pipeline:** Custom scripts automate the generation of the 1200-point question bank and the consolidated "Full Guide" printable PDF.
- **Progress Tracking:** Universal `localStorage` based state management with robust path normalization for consistent production tracking.

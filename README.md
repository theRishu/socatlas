Welcome to **SOCAtlas**, a comprehensive, open-source cybersecurity knowledge base. This repository holds highly structured playbooks, deep technical walkthroughs, and 1200 high-yield revision points designed specifically for Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts, Security Engineers, and Infosec students.

## 🏗️ Local Setup

SOCAtlas is a Python-based static documentation site built with **MkDocs Material**. You do not need Node.js to run it locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theRishu/socatlas
cd socatlas
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r deps.txt
```

---

## 💻 Run Locally

### Development mode with hot reload
Use this while editing markdown content. The site is served at `http://127.0.0.1:8087`.
```bash
sh dev.sh
# or
npm run dev
```

### Production preview on your machine
Use this when you want to preview the same static output that is deployed. This command builds the site into `./site` and then serves it locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8087`.
```bash
sh start.sh
# or
npm run preview
```

### Change the local port
All run scripts support a custom port:
```bash
PORT=3000 sh dev.sh
PORT=3000 sh start.sh
```

---

## 📦 Production Build

### Create the deployable static site
This generates the production output in `./site` and syncs the static Vercel directory in `./public`.
```bash
sh build.sh
# or
npm run build
```

### Deploy output
After the build finishes, deploy the contents of `./site` to your static hosting platform.

## ☁️ Deployment & CI/CD
SOCAtlas is optimized for:
- **Vercel**: Serves the committed `public/` directory as a static deployment with no build step and no runtime functions.
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployed via GitHub Actions to the `gh-pages` branch on every push to `main`.
